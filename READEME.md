# Overview
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
This website is dynamicly loaded and is scalable and to display as much content as needed. 
the content is divided into sections and adheres to the following format:
    {
            "title": "...",
            "subtitle": "...",
            "body": "..."
    }
the title of the section will be used to create an entry in the navigation menu which will link to the section.
the navigation menu utulizes the intersectionObserver() to observe sections and highlight it's respective menu item when the observer detects the section in the viewport.
